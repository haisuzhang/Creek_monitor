# Creek Monitoring Chatbot

This chatbot has been integrated into your Creek Monitoring Dashboard to provide intelligent assistance with water quality data analysis.

## Features

ü§ñ **Intelligent Data Analysis**: Ask questions about water quality trends, site comparisons, and data interpretation

üìä **Real-time Data Access**: The chatbot has access to all your creek monitoring data including E. coli, pH, and turbidity measurements

üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Dashboard Integration**: Chatbot responses can trigger dashboard updates (e.g., selecting specific sites)

üîß **Multiple Tools**: 
- Site information and comparisons
- Water quality summaries
- Trend analysis
- Measurement explanations
- EPA standard compliance checking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The required packages have been added to `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

You need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

For deployment (e.g., Render), add this to your environment variables in the deployment settings.

### 3. Test the Chatbot

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_chatbot.py

## Usage

### In the Dashboard

1. **Chat Interface**: Located at the top of the dashboard
2. **Quick Actions**: Use the buttons for common queries:
   - "Water Quality Summary" - Get an overview of all sites
   - "Compare Sites" - Compare E. coli levels across sites
   - "Available Sites" - List all monitoring locations

3. **Custom Questions**: Type any question about:
   - Specific sites: "Tell me about Peavine creek/Old briarcliff way"
   - Trends: "Show me E. coli trends for the last 8 weeks at Lullwater creek"
   - Comparisons: "Which site has the highest turbidity?"
   - Standards: "Are any sites above EPA standards?"

### Example Questions

- "What's the current water quality at Peavine creek/Oxford Rd NE?"
- "Compare pH levels across all sites"
- "Show me trends for turbidity at Lullwater creek"
- "Which sites are above EPA standards for E. coli?"
- "What does a pH of 7.2 mean for water quality?"
- "Give me a summary of the worst performing sites"
